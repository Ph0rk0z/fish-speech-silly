 I think I'm only remembering the people that I spoke to, because I did make, like I said, I made a lot of friendly eye contact. And then so many moments come out of it, all of the performances, all of the fan interactions and the stuff that you guys do. And it pulls you out of your shell, and you get to meet new people potentially. This is recorded by the way, so if you have stuff to do, I think you can come back and listen to it.
